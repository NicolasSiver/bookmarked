## What is Bookmarked?

Google Chrome extension to manage bookmarks as a part of the new tab experience.

## Background and Motivation

A few years ago, I discovered an exciting take on bookmark organization via a new tab experience in Google Chrome. It was Toby. It was a straightforward extension around tab management. One feature that appealed to me was the ability to organize tabs/bookmarks into collections where all that data would synchronize between work and personal environments. Developers actively supported the extension, and functionality would grow. It started to have more and more features that I did not need, and those features began to compete for the space on the screen and get into valuable experience for tab management via collections. At some point, a requirement was added for a personal account to log into Toby as a service. All of that started diminishing the value of the straightforward feature I liked. A few months ago, an announcement was made that the free plan would become a new type of account with limitations on how many bookmarks you can have in the collections. This is where it started to become a deal breaker.

I think it's possible to have that initial functionality without any additional burden Toby had to aggregate across multiple years of development. This is the idea behind the Bookmarked extension.
